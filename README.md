# Boomer Rider App

An Uber-like application made using Flutter.

Currently this applications supports fetching the user's current location and location nearby drivers. Primary use case of this application is to help daily commuters book a ride and reach their destination such as work place, home, cafe, or any place the user visits regulary, in the quickest way and least amount of taps.

The application features have not been extended to support bookings and driver confirmation, as this is only for showcasing purposes.

The supporting [Driver App](https://github.com/gsbakshi/boomer-driver) can be checked out as well. It's only purpose at the moment is to register a driver and mark them as available, if online, and display on the map to the riders looking to hail a ride from nearby, on the [Rider App](https://github.com/gsbakshi/boomer-rider).

`Supports both iOS and Android.`
